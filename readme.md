# Flask blog
This project is my first flask project. It's based on [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) series of videos on YouTube.

# Important notes
### Setup
Before running the project, we need to set the environment variable `FLASK_APP`. the command on windows is `set` and on
linux it's `export`. So we have to write the following command:  
`set FLASK_APP=<MAIN_FILE>`
### DEBUG
To enable the debug mode, we have to write the following command:  
`set FLASK_DEBUG=1`
### Running the project
`flask run`
